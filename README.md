# Slingshot
## Orbital Dynamics Solver

Slingshot aims to provide a user-friendly astrodynamics experience to non-engineers looking to design spacecraft trajectories. Currently in the early phase with few features.

## Current Features

- Basic trajectory propagation in the Earth-Moon system with _N_-body effects
- Basic simulation controls, including time interval and integration length

## Planned Features

- Multiple planets, all influencing the trajectory
- Plots to allow design of trajectory
- Reference frames
